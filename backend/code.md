This is a very basic and fundamental JavaScript function definition!

Let's break down `function sum(a,b){return a+b; }`:

1. **`function`**: This keyword indicates that you are defining a function.
2. **`sum`**: This is the *name* of the function. You'll use this name to call or invoke the function later.
3. **`(a, b)`**: These are the *parameters* (or arguments) that the function expects.
* `a` is a placeholder for the first value that will be passed into the function.
* `b` is a placeholder for the second value.
4. **`{ ... }`**: These curly braces define the *function body*. All the code inside these braces will be executed when
the function is called.
5. **`return a + b;`**: This is the *core logic* of the function.
* `a + b`: This performs an addition operation on the values of `a` and `b` that were passed in.
* `return`: This keyword specifies the value that the function will "give back" or output when it finishes executing.
Once a `return` statement is encountered, the function stops executing and sends the specified value back to where it
was called.

### What it does:

This `sum` function takes two inputs (presumably numbers), adds them together, and then returns their sum as the output.

### How to use it (Examples):

You can "call" or "invoke" the function by using its name followed by parentheses containing the values you want to pass
in.

```javascript
// Example 1: Storing the result in a variable
let result1 = sum(5, 3);
console.log(result1); // Output: 8

// Example 2: Using directly in console.log
console.log(sum(10, 20)); // Output: 30

// Example 3: With negative numbers
console.log(sum(-5, 10)); // Output: 5

// Example 4: With decimals (floating-point numbers)
console.log(sum(2.5, 3.5)); // Output: 6
```

### Why this is useful:

* **Reusability:** You can call `sum()` multiple times with different numbers without rewriting the `a + b` logic each
time.
* **Modularity:** It breaks down your code into smaller, manageable, and understandable pieces.
* **Readability:** `sum(x, y)` is often clearer than just `x + y` in a complex expression, especially when the function
does something more complicated than simple addition.
